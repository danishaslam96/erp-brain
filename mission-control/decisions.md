# ERP Brain - Decisions Log

## 2026-02-15: Migration to New Protocol
- **Decision**: Migrate ERP Brain to the new hybrid PlanSuite/GitHub protocol defined in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **Context**: The project was stalled waiting for frontend server fixes.
- **Action**: Created new project structure in `projects/erp-brain`, initialized `state.json` (paused), and created `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`.
- **Status**: The project is explicitly marked as `in_progress: false` in `state.json` because the reports frontend server dependency is still blocking.
